# Radardecode

The goals of this repository are to facilitate the maintenance and improve the portability of the radar processing software developed at Arecibo.  The repository allows for the software to be installed and run outside of the Arecibo environment. 


# Credits

Most of the software was initially written by Phil Perillat.
